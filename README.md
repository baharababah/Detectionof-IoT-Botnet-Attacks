# Detection of IoT Botnet Attacks Using Deep Neural Networks
In this project, we build IoT Botnet Attacks detection  using MLPNN. 

## Dataset:
* N-BaIoT dataset, [URL](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/detection_of_IoT_botnet_attacks_N_BaIoT).
* This dataset addresses the lack of public botnet datasets, especially for the IoT. 


## Feature engineering: 
* Handaling unbalanced data using SMOTE(Synthetic Minority Over sampling TEchnique).
* Normalization.
* Shuffling the data.

## Build Neural Networks algorithm that able to controll home appliences : 
* Programming: 
  * Python ( NumPy, Pandas, Keras, Matplotlib, seaborn, imblearn)
